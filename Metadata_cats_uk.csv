variable,class,description
tag_id,character,"A unique identifier for the tag, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a tag ID, an internal Movebank tag identifier may sometimes be shown."
event_id,double,"An identifier for the set of values associated with each event, i.e. sensor measurement. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank. If multiple measurements are included within a single row of a data file, they will share an event ID. If users import the same sensor measurement to Movebank multiple times, a separate event ID will be assigned to each."
visible,logical,"Determines whether an event is visible on the Movebank map. Values are calculated automatically, with TRUE indicating the event has not been flagged as an outlier by algorithm_marked_outlier, import_marked_outlier or manually_marked_outlier, or that the user has overridden the results of these outlier attributes using manually_marked_valid = TRUE. Allowed values are TRUE or FALSE."
timestamp,double,The date and time corresponding to a sensor measurement or an estimate derived from sensor measurements.
location_long,double,"The geographic longitude of the location as estimated by the sensor. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it."
location_lat,double,"The geographic longitude of the location as estimated by the sensor. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it."
ground_speed,double,"The estimated ground speed provided by the sensor or calculated between consecutive locations. Units are reportedly m/s, which indicates that there is likely a problem with this data (either the units were reported erroneously or their is an issue with the sensor data)."
height_above_ellipsoid,double,"The estimated height above the ellipsoid, typically estimated by the tag. Units: meters"
algorithm_marked_outlier,logical,Identifies events marked as outliers using a user-selected filter algorithm in Movebank. Outliers have the value TRUE.
manually_marked_outlier,logical,"Identifies events flagged manually as outliers, typically using the Event Editor in Movebank, and may also include outliers identified using other methods. Outliers have the value TRUE."
study_name,character,The name of the study in Movebank.
